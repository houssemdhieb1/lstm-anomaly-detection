# LSTM-Based Anomaly Detection in Time Series Segments

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates an **AI integration pipeline** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network for **anomaly detection** in time-series data.  
The goal is to identify unusual patterns in sensor or system behavior, which may indicate hardware or subsystem faults.

The implementation includes:
- **Dataset** of time-segmented readings
- **LSTM Autoencoder model** for anomaly detection
- **Inference pipeline** for real-time anomaly classification
- **Documentation and reproducibility** for integration in embedded or CubeSat electronic systems
