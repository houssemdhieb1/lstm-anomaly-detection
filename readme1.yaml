## 📊 Dataset Description

The `dataset.csv` file contains time-segmented sensor readings.  
Each record includes numerical features representing system state over time.

| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `timestamp` | Time or sample index |
| `feature_1`, `feature_2`, ... | Sensor or signal readings |
| *(optional)* `anomaly` | 0 = normal, 1 = anomaly (if labeled) |

If no anomaly labels are available, the model is trained **unsupervised** using normal data only.

## 🧠 Model Description

The **LSTM Autoencoder** is trained to reconstruct normal time-series behavior.  
Anomalies are detected by measuring the **reconstruction error**:

- Low error → normal behavior  
- High error → anomaly  

### Model Architecture
- Input: Sliding time window of N sequential readings  
- Encoder: LSTM layers compress the temporal information  
- Decoder: LSTM layers reconstruct the input sequence  
- Output: Mean squared reconstruction loss
